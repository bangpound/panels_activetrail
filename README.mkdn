Panels Active trail module
==========================

by Benjamin Doherty, bangpound

Panels Active trail allows you to set an active trail directly from Panels variant configuration.

This module is based on [Panels Breadcrumb](http://drupal.org/project/panels_breadcrumbs) which is based on [Panels Everywhere](http://drupal.org/project/panels_everywhere).
